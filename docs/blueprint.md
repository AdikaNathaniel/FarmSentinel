# **App Name**: Farm Sentinel

## Core Features:

- Node Monitoring: Node Status Display: Show node ID, location, active/inactive status, last ping time, and battery level.
- Health Dashboard: Display aggregated health statuses of all nodes including charge status and nodes which have not recently reported. Show node id, alert timestamp and severity level
- Bird Activity Prediction: Predict potential bird activity using gathered weather sensor data (temperature, humidity, rainfall) using a local LLM tool to correlate sensor data
- Event Logging: Provide system triggers (e.g., alerts and node connection/disconnection events) and filtering based on node, date, and alert type.
- Alert Filtering: Implement filtering capabilities based on parameters, like node ID, timestamp, and severity.
- Node Ping: Nodes can be pinged with status feedback displayed

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft beige (#F5F5DC) to evoke a sense of farmland and nature.
- Background color: Light gray (#E0E0E0), a desaturated tone similar to beige, provides a subtle backdrop without distracting from the primary elements.
- Accent color: Olive green (#808000), an analogous color that represents plant life and nature.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif with a modern look, for both headlines and body text.
- Use clean and simple icons to represent nodes, alerts, and weather conditions.
- A dashboard layout for quick monitoring of overall farm health and node status.
- Subtle transitions when updating data and displaying alerts.
